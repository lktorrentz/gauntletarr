# The Media Gauntlet*rr — Functional and architectural spec (v1)

A document consolidated from a user's stream of ideas, reorganized and grounded by comparing it against four related local projects. Not an open brainstorm: wherever something is explicitly undecided, it's flagged as such at the bottom (section 15).

**Name**: project name **"The Media Gauntlet*rr"**, repo/technical name **`gauntletarr`** (*arr style — gauntlet+arr, like Bazarr/Cleanuparr/Prowlarr — without actually depending on Sonarr/Radarr, the same stylistic "wink" Auditorr already does). A deliberately playful nod to the Infinity Gauntlet: a single tool that gives you full control over your entire media/torrent/tracker ecosystem, with one touch (a scheduled "run" or a manual action) fixing what's broken — hence the **Media Stones** theme below, which is not a literal reference to Marvel names/logos (this deliberately avoids any trademark collision: the names and concepts here are original, only genre-inspired).

## Theme: the Media Stones

Six "stones," one per main functional domain — used as a reading key to organize the spec and as the basis for the visual identity (icon/color per module in dashboard and sidebar), not as a rename of the underlying technical concepts (the code/API keeps ordinary descriptive names: `media_item`, `TorrentClientAdapter`, etc. — the Stones are a branding layer on top, not a replacement).

| Stone | Color | Domain | Section |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Stone of Bond** | Blue | Disk/hardlink model, unified per-file state (orphaned/ignored) | §3-4 |
| **Stone of Control** | Purple | Multi-client torrent adapters, presence/seeding state | §5 |
| **Stone of Knowledge** | Yellow | Content identification (TMDB), poster cache | §6 |
| **Stone of Reintegration** | Red | Matching and reseeding engine (repairs broken links) | §6, 8 |
| **Stone of Time** | Green | Scheduling, run history, dashboard trends over time | §8, 10 |
| **Stone of Genesis** | Orange | Upload — gives content "new life" by publishing it to a tracker | §9 |

"Wearing the gauntlet" = having all six Stones configured and active (disks mapped, clients connected, resolver working, matching engine active, scheduler configured, upload ready) — also useful as a metaphor for a future onboarding/setup wizard in the UI: a six-item checklist before the system is "complete."

## 0. Provenance — where this project comes from

This doesn't start from scratch. It synthesizes:

- **`ratio-guardian`** (`/Users/lucazonarelli/Projects/ratio-guardian/docs/SPEC.md`): the most mature architectural analysis and the closest to this scope — a disk/hardlink model with no Unraid/FUSE dependency, a TMDB matching engine with explicit confidence, a reseeding engine with forced recheck, and — decided in that project's most recent session — a second "Upload" mode inspired by Upload-Assistant. Gauntletarr **inherits ratio-guardian's entire data architecture and matching/reseeding engine**, which should be read for the verified implementation details (the real shape of the UNIT3D API, already-fixed known bugs like the season pack size comparison, mediainfo edge cases). This document doesn't repeat those details where they haven't changed, it references them.
- **Auditorr**: reference for the visualization experience — library tree view, per-file state (presence/hardlink/seeding), dashboard with a "library health" gauge, reverse hardlink lookup from the torrent side.
- **Upload-Assistant**: domain reference for the upload flow (mediainfo, screenshots, description, dupe-check, ~90 supported trackers). **In development freeze** as declared by the project itself — to be treated as a domain reference to reimplement against our own contracts, never as a live dependency.
- **smartmediareseed**: reference for verifying file↔torrent identity via **piece hashes** (BEP3) against the hash declared in the `.torrent` — a stronger confidence signal than mediainfo Unique ID alone (which doesn't distinguish different audio tracks on otherwise-identical video). To be integrated as an additional signal in the matching engine (section 6), never as a substitute for a real recheck.

## 1. Vision and problem

The user manages a media library (movies/shows) and one or more torrent seeding folders, often on separate physical disks with no RAID/FUSE. Everyday use accumulates drift:

- files moved/renamed in the library that break the hardlink and therefore seeding, without the user noticing (ratio-guardian's core problem);
- files present in the torrent folder that the torrent client no longer tracks (removed from the client, client reinstalled, a migration never completed);
- files seeding that were never organized/linked into the actual media library;
- downloaded/organized files that were never correctly identified (no TMDB match), and are therefore invisible to any matching logic.

Gauntletarr has to give **a single, coherent view of every file's state**, on both sides (media and torrent) and on the torrent client itself, plus the tools to fix every kind of drift: reseeding, manual linking, uploading new content.

## 2. Genericity requirements (binding, inherited from ratio-guardian §2)

- **Must not assume Unraid/FUSE.** N separate physical disks, each potentially holding part of the library, with no unifying filesystem.
- **Must not assume Sonarr/Radarr.** Optional integration as an additional media resolver adapter, never a dependency.
- **Adapter architecture for trackers, torrent clients and media resolvers**, to allow future extension without rewrites (detail in section 5).
- Distribution: Docker container, web UI for configuration.
- **Designed for public/open source release** (an explicit decision, unlike the source tools which are for personal use): implies example config with no personal data, no hardcoded secrets, clean `.env.example`/`config.example.yaml`, a LICENSE, and care not to assume the original user's specific setup (paths, trackers, disk names) in any default.

## 3. The two directions of the problem: orphaned and ignored

The central point of the original request, distinct from (and complementary to) the "media→torrent" model ratio-guardian already covers. **Both scan directions** need to be maintained, on the same hardlink graph:

### Media → torrent direction (already covered by ratio-guardian's engine)

Files in the media library **without** a valid hardlink to the disk's torrent folder → candidates for the matching/reseeding engine (section 6). This is the "I moved/renamed the file and broke seeding" case.

### Torrent → client/media direction (new requirement for Gauntletarr)

For every file in a disk's torrent folder:

- **Orphaned file**: present on the filesystem (torrent folder) but **not tracked by any configured torrent client** (no torrent in the client whose resolved path points to that file). Typically: a file left behind after removal from the client, a migration that was never finished, a reconfigured client. The natural action: the same reseeding engine as ratio-guardian, but triggered from the torrent side — search the configured trackers for a match for that file (size + mediainfo + piece hash, section 6), and if the match reaches maximum confidence (100%, not the 0.95 threshold used for the media→torrent case — see note below) **download the `.torrent` from the tracker and add it to the client pointing at the file that's already there**, with no need to recreate the hardlink (the file is already in place).
- **Ignored file**: present on the filesystem (torrent folder) and correctly tracked by the client, but **with no hardlink into any enabled `MediaPath`**. It's a seeding file "orphaned from the library": technically healthy, but invisible to the user's media organization. Action: flag only in the UI (never automatic) — the user decides whether it's worth organizing (manual hardlink into a MediaPath) or leaving it as-is (e.g. cross-seeded content that isn't theirs).

**Note on the threshold for torrent-side orphans**: the risk here differs from what's discussed in ratio-guardian §9 (a false positive that leads to seeding the wrong data). Adding a torrent that's already present locally based on a wrong match is still risky (it associates the file with a torrent that isn't a match; the client rechecks it and, worst case, fails — less severe than a false hardlink, but not harmless). So treat it with the **same severity**: a high, configurable threshold, and below it, the manual review queue, exactly as for the media→torrent case — never a bypass "because the file already exists."

### Unified per-file state

Every file (on either side) must expose a composite state, inspired by ratio-guardian's Library page (§12) but extended:

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `seeding` | Valid hardlink + tracked by the client, actively seeding |
| `orphan_media` | In the media library, no valid hardlink (reseeding candidate — media→torrent direction) |
| `orphan_torrent` | In the torrent folder, not tracked by any client (reseeding candidate — torrent→client direction) |
| `ignored` | In the torrent folder, tracked by the client, no hardlink into the media library |
| `unmatched` | No TMDB match resolved (unparsable filename, or no tracker candidate), regardless of side |
| `pending_review` | A match was found but below the confidence threshold, in the manual review queue |

## 4. Data architecture (inherits ratio-guardian §3-4, §13 — extended here)

Disk/library model unchanged from ratio-guardian: a **Disk** entity (physical root, cached `st_dev` to detect remounts), **MediaPath** (one or more per disk, typed `movie`/`tv`), paths always relative to the disk (never absolute), two-level validation (scoped file browser in the UI + `st_dev` comparison at runtime before every hardlink). See ratio-guardian SPEC.md §3 for the full reasoning — not repeated here. Full table-by-table DB schema: `docs/schema.sql`.

### Two supported layouts: per-disk mounts or a single TrashGuide-style mount

`disk_scan_root` (default `/data`, see `config.example.yaml`) supports two deployment styles without any code change:

- **Single mount (TrashGuide convention)**: mount one combined torrents+media folder at `/data` — the same host path shared with the download client and media manager, which is what makes hardlinks between them work. In this layout there's a single Disk, and it's registered with `root_path` equal to `disk_scan_root` itself (`create_disk()` explicitly allows this — the scoping check accepts `root_path == scan_root`, not just a subfolder of it).
- **Per-disk mounts (classic Unraid layout)**: `disk_scan_root` points at a parent folder (e.g. `/mnt`) under which each physical disk is bind-mounted directly (`/mnt/disk1`, `/mnt/disk2`, ...), and each shows up as its own registerable Disk. This is the layout to use whenever a single share might span multiple physical disks in a way that could silently break a hardlink.

Either way, the runtime `st_dev` check before every hardlink (§3, `create_disk`/`verify_disk`) is the actual safety net: even inside a single combined mount, individual files are tracked with their own `st_dev` (not just one value per Disk row) — see "The two FKs" below — so a hardlink attempted across two files that don't really share a device fails with an explicit error rather than silently corrupting anything, whichever layout is in use.

### Why ratio-guardian's model isn't enough as-is

Ratio-guardian merges logical identity and physical file into a single row (`media_item` has both `tmdb_id` and `file_path`/`inode`) and **has no table at all for the torrent client inventory** — it checks "is this already seeding" with a live filesystem check (`find -samefile`) plus a client query only at execution time. That works for a single client with no need to see cross-seeding, but it doesn't hold up against Gauntletarr's requirements (multi-client, a grid view grouped by content, explicit visibility of every cross-seed claimant — §3, §5, §7). Auditorr's model was also analyzed, as a negative reference: it keeps everything in JSON blobs recomputed on every run and, for cross-seeding, merges every claimant on the same inode down to just "the healthiest one" (`audit.py::_walk_directory`, lines 106-124) — an efficient choice, but one that **loses information**, exactly the opposite of what's needed here.

### The entities (physical separated from logical, as discussed)

```
media_item            -- resolved logical identity: tmdb_id, season, episode, poster
  media_file           -- physical, media side: disk_id, relative_path, size, st_dev/inode
                        --   "as of last scan", media_item_id (FK)

seed_file              -- physical, torrent side: disk_id, relative_path, size, st_dev/inode
                        --   "as of last scan", media_file_id (FK, nullable — see below)
                        --   one row per hardlink sibling: 3-way cross-seed = 3 rows

torrent_client          -- config (already exists)
  client_torrent          -- ONE torrent for ONE client instance: info_hash, name, save_path,
                          --   category, state, tracker_url — UNIQUE(torrent_client_id, info_hash)
    client_torrent_file     -- ONE file inside a client_torrent: path_in_torrent, size,
                            --   seed_file_id (FK, nullable)
```

`media_item` is separate from `media_file` (unlike ratio-guardian, where they're the same row) because the grid view (§7) needs to group several physical files under one poster — a common case for a season with multiple episodes, or content with several versions/qualities in the library.

### The two FKs, and why they're written differently

- **`seed_file.media_file_id`** (the inode link, cross-seed): **never computed at runtime with a live join** on `(disk_id, st_dev, inode)` — on a large library that would be recomputed every time the tree/grid view loads. Instead it is:
  1. computed **once per scan**, in memory, during the same `os.walk` already needed to read `st_dev`/`inode`/`nlink` (the same technique Auditorr uses — a dict kept for the duration of the scan — but here **without discarding the "losing" claimants**: every sibling stays a row);
  2. written with a **bulk upsert at the end of the scan** (batch insert/update, never a per-file query);
  3. tagged with `last_scan_id` (a FK to `run_log`) — a `seed_file` not seen again in a later scan isn't deleted right away (the review queue still needs to be able to show it as "gone"), but its `media_file_id` stops being trusted for current-state computations until it's reconfirmed. This avoids the concrete risk of inodes being reassigned by the filesystem between one scan and the next (the same problem already flagged as open in ratio-guardian §17 — made explicit and handled here).
- **`client_torrent_file.seed_file_id`** (the path link, not inode-based): resolved by comparing `client_torrent.save_path + path_in_torrent` against `disk.root_path + seed_file.relative_path` — doesn't suffer from reassignment (a path doesn't get "reused" for a different file the way an inode number does), so it's more stable across scans, though still reverified on every scan for consistency.

On read, every state query (§3) and every dashboard count (§10) is an indexed JOIN on these FKs — never a computation on `st_dev`/`inode` at runtime, which stay **write-only** columns for the scan process.

### Other extensions

- **Poster cache**: `media_item.tmdb_poster_path` (relative TMDB path) + a local cache of the downloaded images (filesystem, not a DB blob — a predictable path like `data/posters/{tmdb_id}.jpg`, downloaded once and reused). Needed for the grid view (§7).
- Static YAML (`disk_scan_root`, `data_dir`) / dynamic DB (disks, media paths, trackers, clients, thresholds) config split — unchanged from ratio-guardian §4.

Matching/reseeding entities (`candidate`, `match_review`, `seed_job`) and the new upload entities (§9) stay as in ratio-guardian, adapted to reference `media_item`/`media_file` instead of ratio-guardian's merged row — full detail in `docs/schema.sql`. One real gap found while building Fase 4: `candidate.media_item_id` alone isn't enough to know *which physical file* a match applies to when a `media_item` has more than one `media_file` (different quality versions of the same content) — never an issue in ratio-guardian, where a media_item *was* the physical file. Fixed by adding `match_review.media_file_id`/`match_review.seed_file_id` (whichever applies to the candidate's `direction`), so the decision — not just the search result — carries the physical file it's about.

## 5. Torrent clients: multi-client support from v1

An explicit requirement, unlike ratio-guardian (which starts with a single qBittorrent adapter and is generically extensible but with no immediate commitment to other clients). Priority:

1. **qBittorrent** — via `qbittorrent-api`, first adapter, implemented (`app/adapters/torrent_client/qbittorrent.py`). **Validated against a real instance** (deployed on Unraid, `POST /api/torrent-clients/{id}/test` confirmed a working connection) — tests still use a mocked client, the real-instance check was manual.
2. **qui** (multi-instance manager for qBittorrent) — resolved **pragmatically** in Phase 2, still unverified against a real instance (the real-instance test above used direct qBittorrent, not through qui): treated as N independent qBittorrent instances, each its own `TorrentClient` with `adapter_type="qbittorrent"` pointed at the `base_url` that `qui` exposes for that instance. No dedicated adapter unless a real installation proves otherwise.
3. **Deluge**, 4. **Transmission**, 5. **rutorrent** — **deferred**, not implemented in Phase 2 (three different protocols — JSON-RPC/RPC/XML-RPC — non-trivial cost for a single pass). `app/adapter_factory.py` raises an explicit error for these `adapter_type` values, never a silent failure.

All behind the same `TorrentClientAdapter` contract — `add_torrent`/`get_torrent_status` inherited unchanged from ratio-guardian §14, **`list_torrents()` replaces the original `list_tracked_paths()` sketch** (implemented in `app/adapters/torrent_client/base.py`, different from this early draft):

```python
class TorrentClientAdapter(ABC):
    def add_torrent(self, torrent_file_or_url, save_path, force_recheck=True) -> str: ...
    def get_torrent_status(self, info_hash) -> TorrentStatus: ...
    def list_torrents(self) -> list[ClientTorrentInfo]:
        """Every torrent known to the client, with its files (path_in_torrent + size).
        Needed to populate client_torrent/client_torrent_file (section 4), not just to
        know whether a path is tracked yes/no — orphan_torrent/ignored/seeding are
        derived from that afterwards, never computed by the adapter itself."""
```

A disk/torrents_rel_path can be associated with several configured clients at once (a common case: qBittorrent for one group of trackers, rutorrent for another, on the same disk) — indexing (`app/torrent_indexer.py`) therefore aggregates across every client enabled for that disk, never assuming a 1:1 relationship.

## 6. Content identification (TMDB) and the matching engine

### Media resolver (inherits ratio-guardian §6)

Default: filename parsing (guessit) → TMDB lookup. Optional Sonarr/Radarr adapter for more reliable mapping, never assumed present.

**Extension for the grid view**: at TMDB resolution time, download and cache the poster (`tmdb_poster_path` → local image, section 4). A `media_item` with no poster available (very niche content, or TMDB doesn't have it) shows a placeholder in the UI, never a blocking error.

### Matching engine (inherits ratio-guardian §7-8, integrated with smartmediareseed)

Pipeline unchanged in structure (personal history if available → catalog search by tmdb_id → size match → mediainfo Unique ID match → explicit, explainable confidence, never opaque ML). See ratio-guardian SPEC.md §7-8 for every verified detail (UNIT3D API shape, season pack handling, the limits of personal history via scraping).

**New confidence signal**, a recommendation already written up in smartmediareseed's analysis and adopted here as a requirement: **piece hash verification** (BEP3 bencode parsing of the downloaded `.torrent`, byte-exact comparison against the local content) as an additional signal, stronger than mediainfo Unique ID alone because it's deterministic and not subject to the known limitation (same video, different audio → sometimes the same Unique ID). To be used to:
- raise confidence when size+mediainfo already agree but aren't absolutely certain;
- **the only signal acceptable for auto-executing the torrent→client direction** (section 3), where a higher threshold than the media→torrent case is needed, because there the file already exists and a wrong match adds a non-matching torrent in a way that's less recoverable with just a recheck.

**A forced recheck on the client remains mandatory in every case** when adding to the client (never `skip_checking`) — the piece hash is a stronger matching signal, not a substitute for the client's own verification.

## 7. Library view: tree + poster grid

Two display modes over the same underlying data (the unified per-file state, section 3), user-selectable, inspired respectively by Auditorr (tree) and the explicit request for a poster grid:

- **Tree view**: the media library's real folder structure (per disk → per MediaPath → subfolders), every file node shows a status badge (colored pill, same states as section 3) and, if available, an inline mini-poster. Clicking a file shows the detail: media path, torrent path (if hardlinked), tracker + direct link, client state + deep link, TMDB link — the same set of columns as ratio-guardian's Library page §12, presented here as a detail panel instead of a table.
- **Grid view**: a card per `media_item` with a TMDB poster (placeholder fallback), title, year, status badge. Meant for quick visual scanning ("what do I have, what's missing, what's broken") rather than technical detail — that stays one click away (the same detail panel as the tree view).
- **Filters shared between both views**: by state (every state from section 3), by disk, by MediaPath/content_type, text search by title.
- **Reverse lookup from the torrent side** (inspired by Auditorr): given a torrent in the client, show which library file(s) it corresponds to (via hardlink) — useful to understand "why is this seeding" without having to search manually.

Both views share the same backend/API — it's just `?view=tree|grid` over the same filtered resource, never two separate data pipelines.

## 8. Reseeding engine and execution

Inherits ratio-guardian §9-11 in full:
- A configurable confidence threshold (default 0.95) above which execution is automatic, below which it goes to the manual review queue — **same logic for both directions** (media→torrent and torrent→client, section 3), possibly with different thresholds for each (see the note in section 6).
- Hardlink with the exact name the tracker expects (media→torrent direction only — in the torrent→client direction the file is already in the right place, only the torrent gets added to the client).
- Forced recheck, never skipped.
- Periodic reconciliation of recheck status (async on the client).
- Bulk import mode (one-off full scan) + scheduled run (cron configurable from the UI), both on the same engine.

## 9. Upload: creating and publishing a new torrent

Inherits ratio-guardian §16 in full, including the reasoning on what to reuse from Upload-Assistant (the `torf` library to create the `.torrent`, extended `pymediainfo`, `ffmpeg-python` for screenshots, dupe-check via the same `TrackerAdapter.search_by_tmdb`) and what not to reuse (no code taken directly from Upload-Assistant, which is in development freeze — only a domain reference for the shape of UNIT3D requests and tracker profiles).

Points that stay unchanged:
- Separate data domain (`upload_job`, `tracker_upload_profile`), never touches the reseeding entities.
- Tracker profiles bundled as seed data versioned in the repo, copied into the DB when a tracker is created, freely editable afterwards and never re-read from the file.
- Mandatory human confirmation before submission, as non-negotiable as the forced recheck in reseeding.
- v1 already includes mediainfo + screenshots (not deferred).

Implemented in Fase 6. Two things found while implementing, not in the original design: `tracker.announce_url` was missing from the schema entirely (`base_url` is the API host, `torf` needs the distinct personal announce URL to create a valid `.torrent`) — added as a nullable column, same additive-migration pattern as every other schema gap found mid-implementation. And `type_id` resolution from a filename is reliable only for `category_id`/`resolution_id` (content type, `screen_size`) — the REMUX/ENCODE/WEBDL/BDMUX distinction is too convention-dependent for a generic guess, so it stays an explicit best-effort default, always editable on the `upload_job` before confirmation, exactly as this section already specified ("resolved, editable before submission").

## 10. UI/UX — general structure

```
Library
  Tree view               (§7)
  Grid view                (§7)
  Orphaned and ignored     [n]  (§3 — both directions, with contextual actions)

Reseeding
  Dashboard
  Review              [n]  (pending match_review, both directions)
  Verify from .torrent
  Runs

  Upload queue        [n]
  Description templates

Configuration
  Disks
  Torrent clients          (multi-client, §5)
  Trackers
  Settings
```

Dashboard: inherits ratio-guardian §15 (library health gauge, pending review/failed/unresolved KPIs, novelty feed) — **additional KPIs** to reflect the two directions: an `orphan_torrent` count and an `ignored` count, each linking directly to the matching filter in Library. Health gauge formula settled in Fase 5 (`app/health.py`): a single explicit, size-weighted ratio (seeding media size / total media size), not Auditorr's multi-factor weighted score (hardlink/orphan/not-imported/duplicates, each independently weighted) — the other KPIs already surface those signals individually and clickably, so folding them again into one composite number would lose clarity rather than add it. "Novelty feed" resolved as the most recent `candidate` rows by `created_at` (`GET /api/dashboard/whats-new`), reusing the timestamp the matching engine already writes rather than a dedicated activity-log table.

Frontend stack: **React SPA + shadcn/ui** (a decision already made in ratio-guardian on 2026-09-21, inherited here from the start instead of as a later refactor — Gauntletarr already starts with a FastAPI backend as a pure JSON API under `/api/*`, no Jinja2/HTMX phase to outgrow). Fase 8 (in corso): scaffold Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui in `frontend/`, tipi TS generati dallo schema OpenAPI di FastAPI (`openapi-typescript`, mai duplicati a mano), servito in produzione dallo stesso container FastAPI (`app/frontend.py`, nessun processo Node separato) — sidebar di navigazione con la struttura sopra già in piedi, le singole pagine arrivano per sotto-fasi successive.

## 11. Tech stack

Inherits ratio-guardian (CLAUDE.md), with additions for multi-client and posters:

- **Python 3.12**, **FastAPI** (pure JSON API under `/api/*`)
- **SQLite** via SQLAlchemy — enough for this load
- **APScheduler** in-process for scheduling
- **httpx** for tracker/TMDB calls (async-friendly)
- **qbittorrent-api**, plus a client library/libraries for Deluge/Transmission/rutorrent (still to be chosen during implementation, section 5)
- **pymediainfo** for mediainfo/Unique ID
- **guessit** for filename parsing
- **torf** to create `.torrent` files for uploads (pure Python)
- **ffmpeg-python** for upload screenshots (needs `ffmpeg` in the container)
- A minimal BEP3 bencode parser (already in ratio-guardian as `app/torrent_file.py`, reusable) — used both for the folder-name fallback (ratio-guardian §7) and for the piece hash (section 6)
- **Frontend**: **React + shadcn/ui** SPA, Vite build, served by the FastAPI container
- **Single container with supervisord** (web + worker/scheduler), same pattern as ratio-guardian

## 12. What to reuse from each source project (summary)

| Project | Reuse |
|---|---|
| ratio-guardian | Data architecture, matching/reseeding engine, adapter contracts — **a direct starting point**, not just inspiration. Python code reusable almost as-is where scope overlaps (torrent_file.py, mediainfo_util.py, adapters). |
| Auditorr | UX reference (tree view, dashboard, reverse lookup) — no direct code reuse (stack/language compatibility to verify during implementation, otherwise a design reference only). |
| Upload-Assistant | Domain reference for upload (tracker request shape, profiles, mediainfo/screenshots) — **no code reuse** (development freeze, incompatible stack: Flask/SSE web_ui vs FastAPI+SPA). |
| smartmediareseed | Piece-hash (BEP3) verification technique, to integrate as an additional confidence signal (section 6) — logic to reimplement against our own contracts, not to import (different Postgres/Flask stack). |

## 13. Open source requirements

- No personal data (paths, trackers, user credentials) in any versioned file — `config.example.yaml`/`.env.example` with generic placeholders.
- An explicit LICENSE (still to choose — MIT/AGPL are the typical picks for this kind of self-hosted tool, AGPL if the goal is discouraging closed-SaaS forks).
- Bundled tracker profiles (section 9) contain only publicly verifiable mapping/naming, never credentials.
- Setup documentation (README) good enough for a third-party user with no context from the design sessions — never assume the reader knows ratio-guardian or the other source projects.

## 14. Suggested roadmap

1. Bootstrap the project (stack, folder structure, requirements) — reusing ratio-guardian's structure/config as a reference.
2. DB schema (disks/media paths/torrent index/tracker/client/media_item with poster/candidate/match_review/seed_job) + SQLAlchemy models.
3. Scoped-per-disk file browser API (a pattern reusable as-is from ratio-guardian).
4. Torrent client adapters: qBittorrent first (direct reuse), then Deluge/Transmission/rutorrent/qui by the priority in section 5.
5. Media resolver (guessit + TMDB) + poster download/cache.
6. Matching engine (size + mediainfo + piece hash) for both directions (section 3), explicit confidence.
7. Review queue UI.
8. Executor: hardlink + add-to-client + forced recheck, both directions.
9. Library view (tree + grid) built on the unified state.
10. Scheduler + run history.
11. Upload module (torf, mediainfo/screenshots, tracker profiles, dupe-check, human confirmation).
12. Cleanup for open source release (example config, LICENSE, README).

Not binding to the letter, but respects the logical dependencies (e.g. there's no point building the Library view before a unified state exists to show).

**Repo**: `https://github.com/lktorrentz/gauntletarr` (public, GPL-3.0). A project **separate from `ratio-guardian`** (confirmed decision: doesn't replace it, doesn't reuse its code as-is — reuses architecture/patterns as described in this document, but has its own repo and history).

## 15. Things explicitly left open (not decided in this session)

- **"qui"'s API surface**: resolved for now with the pragmatic assumption "the qBittorrent adapter pointed at each managed instance is enough" (section 5) — the qBittorrent adapter itself is now validated against a real instance, but not specifically through qui. To confirm once a qui-managed instance is available.
- **Deluge/Transmission/rutorrent adapters**: deferred in Phase 2 (section 5), not implemented — which Python library to use for each is still to be decided when that slice is picked back up.
- **Confidence threshold for the torrent→client direction** (sections 3, 6): whether it's the same 0.95 or higher — still to decide, no number fixed yet.
- Every point already open in ratio-guardian SPEC.md §17 (UNIT3D history scraping, a match cache persisted independently of the physical path, the exact tracker profile schema) stays open here too, unchanged. **Resolved since**: history for the dashboard chart (Fase 5, `run_log.health_snapshot` + `GET /api/dashboard/history`) and the image host for upload screenshots (Fase 6, below).
- **Image host for upload screenshots — resolved in Fase 6**: rather than picking one, wired all three realistic options (PTPImg, ImgBB, Imgbox) as a priority-ordered fallback chain (`ImageHostChain`, `app/adapter_factory.py::build_image_host_chain`) — user's explicit choice over picking a single adapter.
